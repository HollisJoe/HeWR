# Introduction
This is a Matlab implementation of our paper:

**Deep Feature Aggregation and Image Re-ranking with Heat Diffusion for Image Retrieval**

Waiting to be edited. Coming soon...

This is the first version of our program, the image search procedures with 100k distractors are not included in this version. We will add it as soon as possible.

Feature extraction with siaMac is not provided, please refer to the original work for details.
